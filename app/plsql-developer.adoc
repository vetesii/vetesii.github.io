To fix this, download the 32-bit version of Oracle Instant Client, extract it to a directory such as C:\instantclient.

Next, configure PL/SQL Developer to use this version by clicking on Tools -> Preferences. Under Connection -> Oracle Home, point to the location where you had extracted Instant Client (C:\instantclient), and under Connection -> OCI library, point to the oci.dll file in the same directory (C:\instantclient\oci.dll).

Restart PL/SQL Developer and you should be able to connect.
