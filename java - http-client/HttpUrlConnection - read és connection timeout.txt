1) What is the difference between connection and read timeout for sockets? The connection timeout is the timeout in
   making the initial connection; i.e. completing the TCP connection handshake. The read timeout is the timeout on
   waiting to read data. Specifically, if the server fails to send a byte <timeout> seconds after the last byte, a read
   timeout error will be raised.

2) What does connection timeout set to "infinity" mean? In what situation can it remain in an infinitive loop? and what
   can trigger that the infinity-loop dies? It means that the connection attempt can potentially block for ever. There
   is no infinite loop, but the attempt to connect can be unblocked by another thread closing the socket. (A
   Thread.interrupt() call may also do the trick ... not sure.)

3) What does read timeout set to "infinity" mean? In what situation can it remain in an infinitive loop? and what can
   trigger that the infinity-loop dies? It means that a call to read on the socket stream may block for ever. Once again
   there is no infinite loop, but the read can be unblocked by a Thread.interrupt() call, closing the socket, and (of
   course) the other end sending data or closing the connection.

Vagyis a connection timeout mondja meg, hogy mennyi idő alat kell felépítani a kapcsolatot, mig a read timeout adja meg,
hogy két socket read között maximum mennyi idő telhet el. A kapcsolat felépítése ugye párbeszéd már.
