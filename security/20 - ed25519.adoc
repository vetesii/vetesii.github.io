=== Introduction

Ed25519 is a public-key signature system with several attractive features:

* *Fast single-signature verification.* The software takes only 273364 cycles to verify a signature on Intel's widely
  deployed Nehalem/Westmere lines of CPUs. (This performance measurement is for short messages; for very long messages,
  verification time is dominated by hashing time.) Nehalem and Westmere include all Core i7, i5, and i3 CPUs released
  between 2008 and 2010, and most Xeon CPUs released in the same period.
* *Even faster batch verification.* The software performs a batch of 64 separate signature verifications (verifying 64
  signatures of 64 messages under 64 public keys) in only 8.55 million cycles, i.e., under 134000 cycles per signature.
  The software fits easily into L1 cache, so contention between cores is negligible: a quad-core 2.4GHz Westmere
  verifies 71000 signatures per second, while keeping the maximum verification latency below 4 milliseconds.
* *Very fast signing.* The software takes only 87548 cycles to sign a message. A quad-core 2.4GHz Westmere signs 109000
  messages per second.
* *Fast key generation.* Key generation is almost as fast as signing. There is a slight penalty for key generation to
  obtain a secure random number from the operating system; /dev/urandom under Linux costs about 6000 cycles.
* *High security level.* This system has a 2^128 security target; breaking it has similar difficulty to breaking NIST
  P-256, RSA with ~3000-bit keys, strong 128-bit block ciphers, etc. The best attacks known actually cost more than
  2^140 bit operations on average, and degrade quadratically in success probability as the number of bit operations
  drops.
* Foolproof session keys. Signatures are generated deterministically; key generation consumes new randomness but new
  signatures do not. This is not only a speed feature but also a security feature, directly relevant to the recent
  collapse of the Sony PlayStation 3 security system.
* Collision resilience. Hash-function collisions do not break this system. This adds a layer of defense against the
  possibility of weakness in the selected hash function.
* *No secret array indices. The software never reads or writes data from secret addresses in RAM; the pattern of
  addresses is completely predictable. The software is therefore immune to cache-timing attacks, hyperthreading attacks,
  and other side-channel attacks that rely on leakage of addresses through the CPU cache.
* *No secret branch conditions.* The software never performs conditional branches based on secret data; the pattern of
  jumps is completely predictable. The software is therefore immune to side-channel attacks that rely on leakage of
  information through the branch-prediction unit.
* *Small signatures.* Signatures fit into 64 bytes. These signatures are actually compressed versions of longer
  signatures; the times for compression and decompression are included in the cycle counts reported above.
* *Small keys.* Public keys consume only 32 bytes. The times for compression and decompression are again included.

The numbers 87548 and 273364 shown above are official eBATS reports for a Westmere CPU (Intel Xeon E5620, hydra2).

Ed25519 signatures are elliptic-curve signatures, carefully engineered at several levels of design and implementation to
achieve very high speeds without compromising security.
