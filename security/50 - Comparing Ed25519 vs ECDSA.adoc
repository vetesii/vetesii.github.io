There is an important practical advantage of Ed25519 over (EC)DSA: The latter family of algorithms completely breaks
when used for signatures together with a broken random number generator. Such a RNG failure has happened before and
might very well happen again.

Theoretically, implementations can protect against this specific problem, but it is much harder to verify that both ends
are using a correct implementation than to just prefer or enforce (depending on your compatibility needs) an algorithm
that explicitly specifies secure behavior (Ed25519).
