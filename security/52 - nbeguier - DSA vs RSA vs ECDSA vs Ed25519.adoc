*Comparison of the SSH Key Algorithms*

This story is about comparing the main algorithms use to generate an SSH key, describe their weaknesses and place them
on the Moore Law.

How far the main algorithms are, cryptologically speaking, from each other ?

== DSA vs RSA vs ECDSA vs Ed25519

For years now, advances have been made in solving the complex problem of the **DSA**, and it is now **__mathematically__
broken**, especially with a standard key length. Moreover, the attack may be possible to extend to RSA as well.

I’m not saying that you shouldn’t use DSA or RSA, but the key length has to be really long. Of course, there is an
impact during the login.

I suggest you to use elliptic curve cryptography instead. The ECC algorithms supported by OpenSSH are ECDSA and, since
OpenSSH 6.5, Ed25519.

With OpenSSH, NIST curves are used for ECDSA (generally NIST P-256), and according to the article Security dangers of
the NIST curves, it is very likely that an NSA backdoor is hidden there. If the NSA can already crack it, then it won’t
be as hard to crack for somebody else…

Ed25519 is quite the same, but with a better curve (Curve25519).

http://safecurves.cr.yp.to/[safecurves.cr.yp.to] compares elliptic curves, there is a big difference between NIST P-256
and Curve25519 !

Also, DSA and ECDSA have a nasty property: they require a parameter usually called k to be completely random, secret,
and unique. In practice, that means that if you connect to your server from a machine with a poor random number
generator and e.g. the same k happens to be used twice, an observer of the traffic can figure out your private key.

How long do you want to be protected ?

ECRYPT provides rather conservative guiding principles, based on current state-of-the-art research, addressing the
construction of new systems with a long life cycle.

Following their recommendation, we can divide in three categories the protection you want.

=== Legacy standard level

Should not be used in new systems

[source,]
----
RSA key length : 1024 bits
ECDSA / Ed25519 : 160 bits
----

=== Near term protection

Security for at least ten years (2018–2028)

[source,]
----
RSA key length : 3072 bits
ECDSA / Ed25519 : 256 bits
----

=== Long-term protection

Security for thirty to fifty years (2018–2068)

[source,]
----
RSA key length : 15360 bits
ECDSA / Ed25519 : 512 bits
----

== Conclusion

*Never use DSA or ECDSA.*

* *Ed25519* is probably the strongest mathematically (and also the fastest), but not yet widely supported. At least 256
  bits long.
* *RSA* is the best bet if you can’t use Ed25519. At least *3072 bits* long.

Now you are aware of the different algorithms, you can upgrade your SSH Key.

== Why not use SSH Certificate ?

In addition, you can use an SSH Certificate to be much more secure. With this method, you don’t have to worry about the
algorithm, but you will have to sign your public key regularly.
