**Authenticated encryption (AE)** and **authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD)** are forms of encryption
which simultaneously assure the confidentiality and authenticity of data. These attributes are provided under a single,
easy to use programming interface.

== Security guarantees

In addition to protecting message integrity and confidentiality, authenticated encryption can provide security against
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chosen_ciphertext_attack[chosen ciphertext attack]. In these attacks, an adversary
attempts to gain an advantage against a cryptosystem (e.g., information about the secret decryption key) by submitting
carefully chosen ciphertexts to some https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padding_oracle_attack["decryption oracle"] and
analyzing the decrypted results. Authenticated encryption schemes can recognize improperly-constructed ciphertexts and
refuse to decrypt them. This, in turn, prevents the attacker from requesting the decryption of any ciphertext unless it
was generated correctly using the encryption algorithm, thus implying that the plaintext is already known. Implemented
correctly, authenticated encryption removes the usefulness of the decryption oracle, by preventing an attacker from
gaining useful information that the attacker does not already possess.

Many specialized authenticated encryption modes have been developed for use with symmetric block ciphers. However,
authenticated encryption can be generically constructed by combining an encryption scheme and a message authentication
code (MAC), provided that:

* The encryption scheme is semantically secure under a chosen plaintext attack.
* The MAC function is unforgeable under a chosen message attack.

== Programming interface

A typical programming interface for an AE implementation provides the following functions:

* Encryption
	** Input: plaintext, key, and optionally a header in plaintext that will not be encrypted, but will be covered by
		   authenticity protection.
	** Output: ciphertext and authentication tag (message authentication code).
* Decryption
	** Input: ciphertext, key, authentication tag, and optionally a header (if used during the encryption).
	** Output: plaintext, or an error if the authentication tag does not match the supplied ciphertext or header.

The _header_ part is intended to provide authenticity and integrity protection for networking or storage metadata for
which confidentiality is unnecessary, but authenticity is desired.

== History

The need for authenticated encryption emerged from the observation that securely combining separate confidentiality and
authentication block cipher operation modes could be error prone and difficult.[1][2] This was confirmed by a number of
practical attacks introduced into production protocols and applications by incorrect implementation, or lack of
authentication (including SSL/TLS).[3]

Around the year 2000, a number of efforts evolved around the notion of standardizing modes that ensured correct
implementation. In particular, strong interest in possibly secure modes was sparked by the publication of Charanjit
Jutla's IACBC and IAPM modes[4] in 2000. Six different authenticated encryption modes (namely OCB 2.0, Key Wrap, CCM,
EAX, Encrypt-then-MAC (EtM), and GCM) have been standardized in ISO/IEC 19772:2009.[5] More authenticated encryption
methods were developed in response to NIST solicitation.[6] Sponge functions can be used in duplex mode to provide
authenticated encryption.[7]

Bellare and Namprempre (2000) analyzed three compositions of encryption and MAC primitives, and demonstrated that
encrypting a message and subsequently applying a MAC to the ciphertext (the Encrypt-then-MAC approach) implies security
against an adaptive chosen ciphertext attack, provided that both functions meet minimum required properties. Katz and
Yung investigated the notion under the name "unforgeable encryption" and proved it implies security against chosen
ciphertext attacks.[8]

In 2013, a competition was announced to encourage design of authenticated encryption modes.[9]

== Authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD)

AEAD is a variant of AE that allows a recipient to check the integrity of both the encrypted and unencrypted information
in a message.[10] AEAD binds associated data (AD) to the ciphertext and to the context where it is supposed to appear so
that attempts to "cut-and-paste" a valid ciphertext into a different context are detected and rejected.

It is required, for example, by network packets. The header needs integrity, but must be visible; payload, instead,
needs integrity and also confidentiality. Both need authenticity.

== Approaches to authenticated encryption

=== Encrypt-then-MAC (EtM)

The plaintext is first encrypted, then a MAC is produced based on the resulting ciphertext. The ciphertext and its MAC
are sent together. Used in, e.g., IPsec.[11] The standard method according to ISO/IEC 19772:2009.[5] This is the only
method which can reach the highest definition of security in AE, but this can only be achieved when the MAC used is
"strongly unforgeable".[12] In November 2014, TLS and DTLS extension for EtM has been published as RFC 7366. Various EtM
ciphersuites exist for SSHv2 as well (e.g., hmac-sha1-etm@openssh.com).

Note that key separation is mandatory (distinct keys must be used for encryption and for the keyed hash), otherwise it
is potentially insecure depending on the specific encryption method and hash function used.[citation needed]

=== Encrypt-and-MAC (E&M)

A MAC is produced based on the plaintext, and the plaintext is encrypted without the MAC. The plaintext's MAC and the
ciphertext are sent together. Used in, e.g., SSH.[13] Even though the E&M approach has not been proved to be strongly
unforgeable in itself,[12] it is possible to apply some minor modifications to SSH to make it strongly unforgeable
despite the approach.

== MAC-then-Encrypt (MtE)

A MAC is produced based on the plaintext, then the plaintext and MAC are together encrypted to produce a ciphertext
based on both. The ciphertext (containing an encrypted MAC) is sent. Used in, e.g., SSL/TLS.[14] Even though the MtE
approach has not been proven to be strongly unforgeable in itself,[12] the SSL/TLS implementation has been proven to be
strongly unforgeable by Krawczyk who showed that SSL/TLS was, in fact, secure because of the encoding used alongside the
MtE mechanism.[15][dubious – discuss] Despite the theoretical security, deeper analysis of SSL/TLS modeled the
protection as MAC-then-pad-then-encrypt, i.e. the plaintext is first padded to the block size of the encryption
function. Padding errors often result in the detectable errors on the recipient's side, which in turn lead to padding
oracle attacks, such as Lucky Thirteen.
